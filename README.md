### While choosing the best programming language for data science, two of the most popular languages around, **R** and **Python** come to mind but choosing between them is always a dilemma for a data scientist.But the main point is deep understanding of the algorithms and their application can be in any language of choice.

In this series of articles on **Machine Learning in R** we delve into fundamentals of Machine Learning and the various algorithms needed.
